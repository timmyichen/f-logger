## Installation (Mac/Linux)

### Development Server

Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/timmyichen/f-logger
```
*This copies all the files + all the git information from the linked repository, including all the commit histories and stuff.*

Navigate to your f-logger folder:

```
cd f-logger
```

Install the node packages (make sure you're running the latest version of node.js):

```
npm install
```
*This looks in the `package.json` file where all the required packages, or dependencies, are listed, along with their versions, and then installs them*

## Starting the Dev Server

First run both your local mongoDB server with `npm run db`

Wait about ten seconds till you see a ton of text, then start the server with `npm run dev`

You can clear the database by running `npm run db:clear`.
